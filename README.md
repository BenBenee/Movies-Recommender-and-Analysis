Watching a movie has always been a favorite activity to do, either with your family, or couple.
As for myself, i really like killing my time with watching a movie, and I always wonder and amazed by all the creativity and technology in it.
In this notebook, i'll try to gain insight from film industry since 1990 until 2017. The data I got from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) but I made some adjustment on json columns, and adding adjusted budget and revenue for inflation. 


## Content
I seperate this projects into 3 parts:
1. Data Analysis in Data Analysis.ipynb
   in this section I explore data and make some analysis like what is the highest grossing movie  of all time? who is the most successful director? budget and rating correlation, etc.
2. Classification in Classification.ipynb
   In this section I build classifier to predict if movie is a hit or flop based on revenue, and also predict the probability.
3. Recommender in Recommender.ipynb
   For the recommender, I built it from several aspects. Just check it out.
